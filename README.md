## INSTALL

Only tested with Rails 4.2 and Rails 5.1 (should work with any Rails 4.2+ application). Only tested with PostgreSQL.

Add to your `Gemfile` file:
```ruby
group :development do
  gem "localtower", ">= 0.4.1"
end
```

If you want the latest master branch, add to your `Gemfile` file following:
```ruby
group :development do
  gem "localtower", github: "damln/localtower"
end
```

Run command in your terminal:
```bash
bundle install
```

Add to your `config/routes.rb`:
```ruby
MyApp::Application.routes.draw do
  if Rails.env.development? and defined?(Localtower)
    mount Localtower::Engine, at: "localtower"
  end

  # Your other routes here:
  # ...
end
```

## Usage

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000/localtower](http://localhost:3000/localtower).

## Logger Usage (Capture plugin)

You can put this line anywhere in your code:

```ruby
Localtower::Plugins::Capture.new(self, binding).save
```

For example:

```ruby
def my_method
  user = User.find(1)
  some_data = {foo: "bar"}

  Localtower::Plugins::Capture.new(self, binding).save
end
```

Then go to the Localtower intercave here: [http://localhost:3000/localtower/logs](http://localhost:3000/localtower/logs) and you will see the variables `user` and `some_data` in the UI.

### Notes for the Capture plugin:

The value for each variable will try to call `.to_json`. If you have a huge collection of models likes `@users` you will see all the collection as an Array.

## Run test

If you want to contribute to the gem:

Create a `spec/dummy/.env` file with the credentials to your PostgreSQL Database. It should look like this:

```
LOCALTOWER_PG_USERNAME="admin"
LOCALTOWER_PG_PASSWORD="root_or_smething"
```

Run the spec:
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rspec spec/
```
