## INSTALL

Should work with any Rails 5.2+ application.
Only tested with PostgreSQL.

Add to your `Gemfile` file:
```ruby
group :development do
  gem "localtower"
end
```

Run command in your terminal:
```bash
bundle install
```

Add to your `config/routes.rb`:
```ruby
MyApp::Application.routes.draw do
  if Rails.env.development?
    mount Localtower::Engine, at: 'localtower'
  end

  # Your other routes here:
  # ...
end
```

/!\ IMPORTANT /!\
Change your config/environments/development.rb:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  # This is the default:
  # config.active_record.migration_error = :page_load

  # Change it to:
  config.active_record.migration_error = false if defined?(Localtower)

  # ...
end
```

If you know how to override this configuration in the gem instead of doing it in your app code, please open an issue and tell me your solution.

## Usage

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000/localtower](http://localhost:3000/localtower).

## Roadmap

- Be able to use `uuid` instead of `id` as primary when creating models.
- Realtime preview of the migration files
- Better frontend validation

## Run test

If you want to contribute to the gem:

Create a `spec/dummy/.env` file with the credentials to your PostgreSQL Database. It should look like this:

```
LOCALTOWER_PG_USERNAME="admin"
LOCALTOWER_PG_PASSWORD="root_or_smething"
```

Run the spec:
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rspec spec/
```
